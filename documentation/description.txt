This program saves .html files of emails that notify when a Binance transaction
was made (deposits); then extracts the transaction date (UTC) and cryptocurrency quantity
out of the .html file, gets exact cryptocurrency price at transaction date
and writes all the data in a .csv file, which also makes a copy of it in a cloud
storage application such as Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, etc., in order
to have access anywhere at anytime.
